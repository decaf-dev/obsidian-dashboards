Dashboards is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for desktop and mobile. With Dashboards, you can design your own personalized dashboard or home page, tailored to suit your specific needs and workflow.

Dashboards offers flexible grid configurations, allowing you to choose from various layouts such as 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, and more. These grids act as containers where you can embed different elements, including code blocks and markdown assets.

If you are looking for the plugin that was formally called `Dashboards` please see [DataLoom](https://github.com/trey-wallis/obsidian-dataloom)
