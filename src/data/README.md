# data

The data layer contains what is necessary to deserialize JSON data from a `.dashboard` file into an `AppState` object and serialize an `AppState` object into a `.dashboard` file. This includes file creation and also the type definitions for the `AppState`.

The data layer is only used by Obsidian.md components found in the `obsidian` folder or `main.ts`
